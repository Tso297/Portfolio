    Hey everyone! My name is Travis and here is a little bit about myself.

</div class="History">
    My history:

    I grew up in Richmond, VA, as a child with only a mother. She suffered a massive heart attack which caused brain damage.
    At this point it left my brother, sister, and myself to take care of each other. They are the most amazing people anyone could ask for!
    I got through high school and moved out on my own working in the restaurant industry and began college. I got a degree in biochemistry but discovered
    I loved working in restaurants and pursued my cicerone and sommelier licenses after that! This is where I joined the dark side of restaurant
    management I have known for the past decade, doing anything from fine dining, to running night clubs, and even opening a concept of my own.
